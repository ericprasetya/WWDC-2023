# enCanting ✨
enCanting is my personal project application for Swift Student Challenge 2023. The name "enCanting" comes from the tool used in batik making, the 'Canting', and the added 'en' gives it a charming sound like ‘enchanting’.

enCanting has features to provide experience in the process of making batik, which starts from depicting the pattern with wax (called 'malam' in Javanese). The purpose of using wax is so that the wax-covered cloth is not stained when the color is added later. I applied the drawing of this pattern to the application by asking the user to draw on the screen according to the given batik pattern.

After the pattern is drawn, then the cloth needs to be colored. I implemented this by using the ColorPicker and DragGesture in SwiftUI so that the user can select a color and drag it onto the batik cloth.

After being colored, the batik cloth needs to be soaked in hot water so that the wax that covers the pattern melts and becomes the actual batik cloth after it dries.

The goal of enCanting is to raise awareness about the process of batik. Through this interactive app, users can experience the beauty and intricacies of batik making and gain a deeper appreciation for this timeless art form.
